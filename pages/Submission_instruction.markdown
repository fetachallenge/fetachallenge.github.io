To submit your algorithm to the FeTA challenge, you need to provide a Docker image file as well as a brief [Algorithm Description](https://fetachallenge.github.io/pages/Algorithm).

**We are not going to release the test set**, therefore we require participants to wrap their solutions in a Docker container based on a provided template so it can be automatically run on our servers.

{% include notification.html
message="You can find the template on [GitHub](https://github.com/fetachallenge/fetachallengesubmission). Please follow the instructions in the ``README`` file to learn how to integrate your solution in this template. It is compulsory to use it for the submission."

Once you successfully build your Docker container, save it to a zipped file and upload  to cloud platforms such as [Mega](https://mega.io/zh-hans/), [Google Drive](https://www.google.com/drive/), [WeTransfer](https://wetransfer.com/).

To submit your algorithm we ask you to send us the download link to [feta-challenge@googlegroups.com](mailto:feta-challenge@googlegroups.com) with the title ``'FeTA 2024 Submission [TEAMNAME] Docker Container Submission'``. The deadline for the Docker submission is the **31st July 2024**.


Please remember to fill in and send the form with your submission description by the **12th August 2024**. Find more information here: [FeTA Challenge Algorithm Description](https://fetachallenge.github.io/pages/Algorithm).
