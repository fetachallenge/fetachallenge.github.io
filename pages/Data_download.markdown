This year’s FeTA dataset will consist of data from multiple institutions, and therefore there are 2 steps to download the data.

***

 1. Request access and download the FeTA 2022 data from the University Children’s Hospital Zurich:

      * You acknowledge that the owner of the Fetal Tissue Annotation Challenge Dataset available on Synapse is the University Children’s Hospital Zurich.
      * You agree to use Fetal Tissue Annotation and Segmentation Dataset  only for research and education purposes. Any other kind of use you will lead to recall of all datasets, stop of collaboration and legal consequences.

 2.  Request access to the FeTA 2022 data from the Medical University of Vienna 

      The FeTA 2022 data from the Medical University of Vienna has been provided only for the purpose of the FeTA 2022 challenge and thus the sharing stopped after the submission deadline on 4th of August 2022.
