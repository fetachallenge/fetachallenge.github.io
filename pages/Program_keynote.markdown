Neuroimaging of the developing brain, despite its technical challenge, has been shown to be important to tool to visualize the brain development and to assistant diagnosis of developmental diseases. This talk will cover our recent endeavors to develop advanced imaging acquisition and motion correction strategies for imaging the fetal brain. I will then describe the generation of spatiotemporal atlas of fetal and infant brains, as well as the large data-based neuroimaging analysis of brain development.

Dan Wu is currently a Professor at Zhejiang University. Dr. Wu obtained her Bachelor’s degree from Zhejiang University and master and PhD degrees from the Department of Biomedical Engineering at Johns Hopkins University. She served as an Assistant Professor at the Department of Radiology, Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine.

Dr. Wu’s research focuses on the development of MRI pulse sequence and neuroimage analysis techniques, with a focus on diffusion MRI and developmental neuroscience. Dr. Wu has published over 100 peer-reviewed journal articles on PNAS, Science Advances, Radiology, etc. She is the PI of over 10 national and provincial projects. She was awarded Innovator under 35 China by MIT Tech Review, Young Scientist of World Economic Forum, Excellent Youth Project of NSFC, etc. Dr. Wu served the Associate Editor of Human Brain Mapping, and the Chair of Pediatric MR Study Group and the Secretary of the Diffusion MR Study Group of the International Society of Magnetic Resonance in Medicine (ISMRM).
