The Fetal Tissue Annotation and Segmentation Challenge (FeTA) is a multi-class, multi-institution image segmentation and biometry challenge part of [MICCAI 2024](https://conferences.miccai.org/2024/en/). The goal of FeTA is to **develop effective, domain-generalizable and reproducible methods for analyzing high resolution reconstructed MR images of the developing fetal brain** from gestational week 21-36. The challenge provides manually annotated, super-resolution reconstructed MRI data of human fetal brains which will be used for training and testing **automated multi-class image segmentation and biometric measurements prediction**.

In [FeTA 2021](https://feta.grand-challenge.org/feta-2021/), we used the [first publicly available dataset](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41597-021-00946-3) of fetal brain MRI to encourage teams to develop automatic brain tissue segmentation algorithms ([challenge paper](https://https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1361841523000932)). [FeTA 2022](https://feta.grand-challenge.org/feta-2022-top-5-submissions/) took it to the next level by launching a multi-center challenge for the development of image segmentation algorithms that generalize to different hospitals with unseen data ([paper under review](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.09463)). 


This year, **FeTA 2024 includes** a new clinically relevant task on **automated biometry** measurements and data from five **different sites and magnetic fields** including recent **low-field systems**. The accepted full proposal can be found [here](https://zenodo.org/records/10986046). We believe that these algorithms will have the potential to contribute to our understanding of the developing normal and pathological human brain across hospitals and research institutions worldwide.

## Format

This year, FeTA challenge will be held jointly with the [PIPPI](https://pippiworkshop.github.io/) (Perinatal, Preterm and Paediatric Image analysis
 ) workshop. Detailed program for the workshop and challenge will be announced soon on the [Program](/pages/Program) page.
