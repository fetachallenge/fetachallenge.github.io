The Fetal Tissue Annotation and Segmentation Challenge (FeTA) is a multi-class, multi-institution image segmentation
 challenge part of [MICCAI 2024](https://conferences.miccai.org/2024/en/). The goal of FeTA is to develop effective, domain-generalizable and reproducible
  methods for analyzing high resolution reconstructed MR images of the developing fetal brain from gestational week 21-36. The challenge provides manually annotated, super-resolution reconstructed MRI data of human fetal brains which will be used for training and testing automated multi-class image segmentation algorithms.

In FeTA 2021, we used the first publicly available dataset of fetal brain MRI to encourage teams to develop automatic brain tissue segmentation algorithms. FeTA 2022 takes it to the next level by launching a multi-center challenge for the development of image segmentation algorithms that will be generalizable to different hospitals with unseen data. This year, FeTA 2024 includes a new clinically relevant task on automated biometry measurements and data from five different sites and magnetic fields including recent low-field systems.



Such new algorithms will have the potential to contribute to our understanding of the developing normal and pathological human brain across hospitals and research institutions worldwide.

## Participation
To participate in the challenge, please send an email to [feta-challenge@googlegroups.com](mailto:feta-challenge@googlegroups.com) with the HEADLINE 'FeTA 2024 Participate'. We will send you the password to download the dataset. 



## Data Release: 

The complete dataset for the FeTA 2024 Challenge will be released soon. Instructions for downloading the challenge dataset are in  [Data](/pages/Data_description) subsection.  


## Program: 

This year, FeTA challenge will be held jointly with the [PIPPI](https://pippiworkshop.github.io/) (Perinatal, Preterm and Paediatric Image analysis
 ) workshop. Detailed program for the workshop and challenge will be announced soon on the [Program](/pages/Program) page.
